LVM provides a flexible approach to storage:

  - Volumes can consist of more than one disk.

  - Volumes can be made smaller or larger easily.

  - It is easy to replace failing disks.

  - Provides advanced options like working with snapshots - a method by
    which backups can be made of files while theyâ€™re open\!

  - It is easy to add many new volumes. While with partitions, there is
    a limit of 15 partitions, there can be as many as 256 logical
    volumes.
