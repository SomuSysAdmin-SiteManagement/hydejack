Both `cron` and `at` enable us to perform a task in the future. However,
cron lets us perform a job on a regular basis, while if we only need to
perform a task once in the future, we use at.

## Cron

Cron uses the `crond` service which is started by default and in turn
used by many services. The configuration files for cron reside in
various locations, and this allows RPMs to drop shell scripts in cron
without any interruption or change of config. It also allows users to
create their own cron jobs.

## at

at which uses the `atd` daemon runs tasks only once in the future at a
pre-scheduled time. The at command is used to add jobs.
