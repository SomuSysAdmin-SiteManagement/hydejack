The network configuration is stored in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`
directory. There are several configuration files for each interface. The
configuration file for the *ens33* interface is called `ifcfg-ens33`.
The script looks like:

``` bash
TYPE=Ethernet
PROXY_METHOD=none
BROWSER_ONLY=no
BOOTPROTO=none
DEFROUTE=yes
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE=stable-privacy
NAME=ens33
UUID=1909bf04-c383-4aa0-afce-d774be49d3d4
DEVICE=ens33
ONBOOT=yes
HWADDR=00:0C:29:D6:73:D0
MACADDR=00:0C:29:D6:73:D0
IPADDR=192.168.4.44
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=192.168.4.2
DNS1=8.8.8.8
```

The BOOTPROTO can be set to *dhcp* if DHCP is required. The
*ONBOOT="yes"* sets that the NIC should be switched on during boot. The
HWADDR property specifies the MAC address. IPADDR can be specified as
IPADDR0 and thus more than one ip addresses can be specified as IPADDR1,
IPADDR2, and so on.

## Hostname

In the `/etc` directory, there is a file called **hostname** which
contains the hostname of the machine we’re working on. In earlier
versions of RHEL, this information used to be stored in
`/etc/sysconfig/network/`.

Another important file that isn’t used anymore is `/etc/resolv.conf`.
This file is auto-generated by the Network Manager, the most important
part of the system that handles network configuration.
