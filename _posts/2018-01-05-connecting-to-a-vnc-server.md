To connect to the VNC server, we need the **vncviewer** utility. The
basic syntax of the `vncviewer` command is: `vncviewer -via
<vnc-username>@<vnc-host> <vnc-host>:1`. So, when testing it on
localhost, weâ€™ll use:

``` console
# vncviewer -via vncuser@localhost localhost:1

```

When the above command is executed, first SSH authentication occurs,
followed by VNC authentication. If both authentications are passed, a
remote session on the server for that particular user (i.e., *vncuser*
in our case) is started.
